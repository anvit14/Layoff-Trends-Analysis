# Layoff-Trends-Analysis
Problem Statement:
A recruitment company aims to extract actionable insights from layoff analysis to effectively navigate the job market and seize opportunities.

Key Recommendations:

Target High-Layoff Companies: Prioritize analysis on prominent post-IPO firms. Notably, Amazon and Meta account for a combined 48,000 layoffs, surpassing the total layoffs of the next five companies combined.

Focus on Key Markets: Delve into job market challenges in the United States and India, the primary contributors to global layoffs. With the USA reporting over 300,000 layoffs, understanding this market is paramount.

Sector-Specific Approach: Concentrate efforts on the Consumer Industry and Retail Sector, which collectively witness 110,000 layoffs. Provide tailored support to startups at seed and Series A funding stages to address their elevated layoff rates (0.5% and 0.25%, respectively) and to assist with hiring needs during the recovery phase.
